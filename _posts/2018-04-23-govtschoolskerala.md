 I was traveling in a train from kochi to trivandrum. As it was a general compartment without those thick curtains to seperate human beings from other human beings, I struck a converstation with a young girl fresh out of college preparing for admission into postgraduate courses in the field of social work. It really fascinates me how a substaintial proportion of girls in kerala choose to get into nursing or social work. I guess it makes sense given that, it had the first demacratically elected communist government in the world, though all parties are more-or-less similar nowadays.

 One striking revelation from this converstation was that - Government schools are as good as private ones, sometimes better than them. She actually had a chance to study in both schools due some circumstances. This really led me to explore further as to - why government schools in kerala are so much better than similar schools in other states ?

 I started with what an astute Data Scientist would do, tried to look for data related to government schools across different states in India. This looked much like a tsunami of data and I decided to visualize it to make some sense out of it. D3 was my friend again!
