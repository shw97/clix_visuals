             <p>This page contains doumentation of methodology and processes involved in generating visualisations of this website.
		We have a section for each type/super-set of visualisation, with all the information about data source, processing and 
		different metrics used. As all the information related to every visualisation is in one page, it easier to navigate 
		through them and see interlinks between different data visualisations.</p>

		       <h4>Data Source:</h4>
		       <p>Primary Source of tools data is json file generated whenever a user accesses Tools/Apps section of the 
			  CLix software. These files along with other thin data are available from schools as part of synthing data.
			  In a given school (in a particular machine), seperate json file is generated for each tool. 
			  This json file will have logs of all the users of the tool on that machine.
                       </p>

		      <div class="section" id="data_processing"> 
			<h4>Data Processing:</h4>
	 	       <p>To process tools data, we first convert json files into csv files extracting only information relevant for our analysis.
		        All these csv files of tools across all the schools is collated to create one big csv file. Each row of this csv file corresponds to 
			a unique log of a user with the following features (columns): </br></br>

		      <i>school_server_code</i>: Unique code of the school in which log is generated</br>
		      <i>user_id</i>: Unique id of a student creating the log</br>
		      <i>tool_name</i>: Tool name of the tool being accessed</br>
		      <i>created_at</i>: Timestamp of creation of the log </br>
		      <i>date_created</i>: Date of creation of log </br>
		      <i>time_spent</i>: Time spent by a student(=user_id) on the tool(=tool_name) on a given day(=date_created). This is 
		      calculated by taking time difference between first and last log time_stamps of a every user_id in a given day.</br>
		      <i>state_code</i>: State in which machine is located</br></br>

		        <h4>Calculation of Metrics:</h4> 
                        <p>
                        <h5>Total Days Accessed</h5> 
		          <p>This corresponds to total number of days tools section was accessed(irrespective of the time they spent) by unique students. 
		           In a given school, it is calculated by considering unique combinations of tool_name and user_id, then adding up number of unique 
		           date_created entries for each combination. This sum gives us the total number of unique days a tool was accessed by all users.</p>
                       <h5>Average Number of Students in a Day</h5>
		          <p>This gives us the number of students accessing the tools section of the platform in a day on an average. In a given school, for each 
		          unique combination of tool_name and date_created, we add up number of unique user_id's.  </p>
                       <h5>Average Time Spent by a Student in a Day</h5>
		         <p>For a given school, all unique combinations of tool_name, user_id and date_created are considered, then for each of these time_spent 
		          is added up. This gives us the average time spent (averaged across students and days) for each tool.</p>

	   		  <p>Python is a widely used programming language that has recruited enthusiasts from
	   		  many professions: web programmers, game engineers, scientists, academics, and
	   		  even designers of new programming languages. When you learn Python, you join a
	   		  million-person-strong community of developers. Developer communities are
	   		  tremendously important institutions: members help each other solve problems,
	   		  share their projects and experiences, and collectively develop software and
	   		  tools.  Dedicated members often achieve celebrity and widespread esteem for
	   		  their contributions.</p>
	   		  
	   		  <p>The Python language itself is the product of a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/psf/members/">large volunteer community</a> that prides itself on the <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org/community/diversity/">diversity</a> of its contributors. The language
	   		  was conceived and first implemented by <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido van Rossum</a> in the late 1980's.
	   		  The first chapter of his <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/tutorial/appetite.html">Python 3 Tutorial</a> explains why Python is so
	   		  popular, among the many languages available today.</p>
	   		  <p>Python excels as an instructional language because, throughout its history,
	   		  Python's developers have emphasized the human interpretability of Python code,
	   		  reinforced by the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">Zen of Python</a> guiding principles of beauty, simplicity, and
	   		  readability. Python is particularly appropriate for this text because its broad
	   		  set of features support a variety of different programming styles, which we will
	   		  explore. While there is no single way to program in Python, there are a set of
	   		  conventions shared across the developer community that facilitate reading,
	   		  understanding, and extending existing programs. Python's combination of great
	   		  flexibility and accessibility allows students to explore many programming
	   		  paradigms, and then apply their newly acquired knowledge to thousands of
	   		  <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi">ongoing projects</a>.</p>
	   		  <p>These notes maintain the spirit of <a class="reference external" href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp">SICP</a> by introducing the features of Python
	   		  in step with techniques for abstraction and a rigorous model of computation. In
	   		  addition, these notes provide a practical introduction to Python programming,
	   		  including some advanced language features and illustrative examples. Increasing
	   		  your facility Python should come naturally as you progress through the text.</p>
	   		  <p>The best way to get started programming in Python is to interact with the
	   		  interpreter directly. This section describes how to install Python 3, initiate
	   		  an interactive session with the interpreter, and start programming.</p>
